**This plugin is incomplete and unmaintained**. I'm only publishing it because it might be a useful starting point for someone.

This is a draft of a Magento 2.3.1 plugin I made a few years ago, to make a shipping method mandatory at checkout when a specific payment method is selected and the order amount is above a theshold.

The plugin uses paypal-express as the payment method to force. There's likely a better way to accomplish this than using JavaScript.
